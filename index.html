  <h3>Career and Education</h3>
  <p>My career was not driven by my education, in fact, I took quite the opposite route to build my career. Having dropped out of college at the age
    of 21 years old, I ended up just starting to work and building a professional toolkit that allowed me to excel in my career. This was the basis for
    creating NPC. My education, equally important to me, came second, but when it was the right time in my life for it.</p>
